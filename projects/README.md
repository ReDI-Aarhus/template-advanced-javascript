# 🛠️ Student Projects – JavaScript with React

Welcome to the `projects/` folder!  
Here you will submit and store your **final project** for the JavaScript with React course.

## 📁 Folder Naming Convention

Each team should create a folder inside `projects/` following this naming format:

projects/team-[project-name]

Examples:
- `projects/team-movie-hub`
- `projects/team-weather-app`
- `projects/team-react-tickets`

Use lowercase letters and hyphens (`-`) instead of spaces.

Inside your team folder, include at minimum:
- A `README.md` describing your project, features, and how to run it
- Your codebase (React project)
- Any relevant assets or documentation
