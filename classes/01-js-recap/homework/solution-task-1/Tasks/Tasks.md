### Task 1: HTML and CSS Basics

#### Task Description:
Recall the basics of HTML by creating the structure of a movie application. Create a header with the title "My Favorite Movies" and a section to add new movies with form inputs for the movie's name, genre, release year, director, and description.

### Task 2: JavaScript Data and Functions

#### Task Description:
Recall JavaScript basics by defining an array of movie objects with properties: `name`, `genre`, `releaseYear`, `director`, and `description`. Next, create a function `displayMovies` that will display these movies on the webpage.

Implement the `addMovie` function to add new movies to the list. This function should gather the data from the form inputs and create a new movie object that is added to the movies array.

### Task 4: Filtering and Sorting Movies
