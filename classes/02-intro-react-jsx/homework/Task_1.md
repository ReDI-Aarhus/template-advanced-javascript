# 🏠 Homework – Class 02: Intro to React & JSX

## 📌 Objectives
- Make sure your development environment is fully set up.
- Build your first React app.
- Practice working with JSX and components.

---

## 💻 Tasks

1. **Set Up Your React App**
   - If not done in class, use `create-react-app` or `Vite` to scaffold your first React app.
   - Make sure the app runs in your browser (`npm start` or `npm run dev`).

2. **Edit the App Component**
   - In `App.jsx` or `App.js`, change the message on the page to something personal (e.g., "Hello from [Your Name]!").
   - Add at least one more element, such as a heading, list, or image.

3. **JSX Practice**
   - Create a new functional component (e.g., `MyComponent.jsx`).
   - Use it in your main `App.jsx` file.
   - Try passing props into it and rendering dynamic values.

4. **Bonus (Optional)**
   - Try applying some inline styling or add a CSS class.
   - Browse the [React documentation](https://react.dev) and find something new or surprising. Add a comment in your code explaining what you learned.
